## 🤖 AI Involvement

This portfolio website was created with the assistance of Microsoft Copilot, an AI companion. Copilot helped structure the site, generate the HTML/CSS template, and draft supporting documentation.

While the content (resume details, personal information, and career highlights) is my own, the design and code were guided by AI. I want to be clear that this project is a collaboration between myself and Copilot, rather than something I coded entirely by hand.
